This project requires that Node and NPM are installed.

From the base directory of the repository run `npm install` to install the needed modules from `package.json`.

NPM can then be used to run the tests through the command `npm test`.

Individual test files can be run by appending the file path to `npm test`, for example `npm test ./user.test.js`.
